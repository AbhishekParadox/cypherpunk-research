# cypherpunk-research

This repository is essentially for compiling information about Cypherpunks, the history of the movement, and the people/events of note. I intend to use the research here to write a series of articles, and maybe a book if time allows.

Given that a large amount of the notable events and people are related to crypto-currency, a lot of this list will be about Bitcoin/Ethereum/etc. This isn't a "crypto-currency history" list though, it's a broader "cypherpunk history" project. This is why people like Julian Assange, Weev and Paul Calder Le Roux are included. Julian Assange was a 90s cypherpunk, but isn't a bitcoiner (except for Wikileaks accepting it for donations). Weev and Paul Calder Le Roux are people who, to me, represent the beginnings of outcomes predicted by cypherpunk theory. Paul Calder Le Roux in particular represents the dark side of the "specter of crypto anarchy".

I'm going to do my best to avoid giving this list any internal political bias. By this I mean that I will be openly biased in favour of Cypherpunk ideals themselves, but I will try to avoid picking a side in things like the block-size debate. If you feel any of my wording is biased, feel free to send me a PR to correct it, and I will try to evaluate it fairly.

The reason I'm putting this archive on github is to make it easier for others to add sources as a pull request. Whatever I end up doing with the information collated here, this organised list could be useful to the community at large.
