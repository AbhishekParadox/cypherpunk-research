# cypherpunk-research
This repository is essentially for compiling information about Cypherpunks, the history of the movement, and the people/events of note. I intend to use the research here to write a series of articles, and maybe a book if time allows.

I'll start out with just this README file, but overtime, it will likely expand to a more complex structure.

The reason I'm putting this archive on github is to make it easier for others to add sources as a pull request. Whatever I do with the information collated here, it could be useful to the community at large.
