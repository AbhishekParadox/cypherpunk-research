Firstly, I want to note that it is my intention not to let this being a wikipedia-edit-war style battle between Big-blockers and Small-blockers. I personally am a Small-blocker and SegWit/Lightning supporter and I do not believe Craig Wright is Satoshi. That said, I promise to do my best not to let that bias seep into this list. If you spot something that you think is unfairly worded, let me know.

If you are a technical person who is familiar with Pull Requests, feel free to just fork this list, make your changes and add a Pull Request. I can't promise I'll accept your PR if I feel the addition isn't noteworthy enough. I may also ask you to change wording if I feel it contains bias. If you are non-technical, you can just add an issue making me aware of your proposed addition. If you don't have a GitHub account (and are opposed to making one), you can tweet at me [@_tombusby](https://twitter.com/_tombusby).

What do I class as bias? For example, if you were to attach a source detailing/alleging censorship in /r/bitcoin I will not consider that as bias as long as the source is high quality. [This](https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) is what I would consider a high quality post. /r/btc shitposting about Theymos with no substance/backing/evidence I will not consider for addition.

Exact dates should be given in the following format: 31-Oct-2008. This is because this format is unambigious when accounting for US vs inernational date standards. Always use three-letter months. Other date formats I'll accept are:

* 1990s (for a broad period of time without clear beginnings and ends)
* Aug-Sep 2013 (for a month-to-month range in the same year)
* Aug 2013-Sep 2015 (for a month-to-month range in different years)
* 2008/2009 (for an ongoing period of time with an unclear start date - i.e. was Bitcoin created by the genesis block, or the announcement of the white paper?)
